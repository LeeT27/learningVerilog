# learningVerilog
Self-studying Verilog, my first HDL, through projects simulated with Icarus Verilog & GTKWave, extending beyond UIUC coursework (Began 9/22/25)

## Project 1: Three Input  gate (9/23/25)
My first Verilog project focused on designing and combining basic logic gates to simulate (A AND B) OR C in a waveform

**Key Features / Learning Outcomes**  
- Initialized logic gate modules ('and_gate', 'or_gate') with two input ports and one output
- Created a top module to combine sub-modules with every input combination
- Configured a testbench to verify correct logic operation
- Learned to simulate Verilog code using **Iverilog** and visualize waveforms with **GTKWave**.
- Generated and analyzed waveform files (`.vcd`) to confirm truth table outputs
