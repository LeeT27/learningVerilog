# learningVerilog
Self-studying Verilog, my first HDL, through projects simulated with Icarus Verilog & GTKWave, extending beyond UIUC coursework (Began 9/22/25)

## [Project 1: AND-OR Logic Circuit](https://github.com/LeeT27/learningVerilog/tree/main/AND-OR%20Logic%20Circuit) (9/23/25)
My first Verilog project focused on designing and combining basic logic gates to simulate **(A AND B) OR C** in a waveform for output **y**

**Key Features / Learning Outcomes**  
- Simulated **(A AND B) OR C**
- Initialized logic gate modules (`and_gate`, `or_gate`) with two input ports and one output
- Created a top module to combine sub-modules with every input combination
- Configured a testbench to verify correct logic operation
- Learned to simulate Verilog code using **Iverilog** and visualize waveforms with **GTKWave**.
- Generated and analyzed waveform files (`.vcd`) to confirm truth table outputs

## [Project 2: 8-Bit RCA](https://github.com/LeeT27/learningVerilog/tree/main/8-bit%20Ripple%20Carry%20Adder%20(RCA)) (9/23/25)
This project takes two 8-bit inputs and outputs the sum without overflow
