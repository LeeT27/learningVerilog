# learningVerilog
Self-studying Verilog, my first HDL, through projects simulated with Icarus Verilog & GTKWave, extending beyond UIUC coursework (Began 9/22/25)

## Project 1: Three Input  gate (9/23/25)
My first Verilog project focused on designing and combining basic logic gates to simulate (A AND B) OR C in a waveform
**Key Features / Learning Outcomes**  
- Implemented AND, OR, and XOR gates as separate Verilog modules.  
- Created a top module to combine and test all gates with different inputs.  
- Learned to simulate Verilog code using **Iverilog** and visualize waveforms with **GTKWave**.  
- Practiced writing clear, modular, and reusable code for digital circuits.
